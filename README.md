If you want to purchase your own domain, then head over to Hostinger. However, if you're simply looking to learn how to build a web application, you don't need to worry about a domain as I can help you host your website for free.

### let's start

First, you need a code editor like Visual Studio Code (VS Code). I personally recommend VS Code because it is the best code editor, offering a wide range of extensions to help you write better code. VS Code is a powerful and versatile tool that can be used for a variety of programming languages and tasks, making it an ideal choice for developers of all levels. With its intuitive user interface and comprehensive set of features, VS Code is the perfect choice for anyone looking to write better code.

**Now, follow my steps step-by-step for success.**

Step-1:  Create a folder named  `gpt-3-ui`. And open the folder in vs code.

Step 2: Open the terminal and write the command `npx create-react-app ./` and press enter.

Step-3: if your app is successfully created then write ``npm start`` on the terminal and press enter and you can view your app on a browser with the help of ``http://localhost:3000``.

Step-4: now, you go to delete the ``src`` folder


Step-5: create a new ``src`` folder and create some files in the ``src`` folder ``index.Js``, ``App.js``, `App.css`.


Step-6: write code in the  ``index.Js``, ``App.js``, and ``App.css`` files.
